# Python OOP

### About the course

The Python OOP course will teach students the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), how to work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, and build hierarchies of classes. Basic 
OOP principles such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism will be studied. You will delve into the most commonly used design patterns (creational, 
structural and behavioral design patterns). It will introduce students to SOLID principles for object-oriented software design, as well as what iterators and generators are and how to  how to use them. 
Students will learn how to create and use decorators. Attention will be paid to component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
