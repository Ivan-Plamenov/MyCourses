# JavaScript Back-End

### About the course

The "JS Back-End" course is intensive and aims to introduce students to developing server-side JavaScript applications on the Node.js platform using Express.js as a framework. During the course students 
will understand how to create a server with Node.js, learn the server-client architecture and how to make easy and fast data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB using modern 
techniques and tools. One of the most popular non-relational databases, MongoDB, will be covered along with the Mongoose library for taking data from it. Towards the end of the course you will build from 
scratch a complete REST API using Express.js and MongoDB. There is a lot of emphasis on hands-on exercises to get involved in real-world web page development projects, implementing snippets of 
websites and creating complete modern websites with good vision, modern structure and mobile support.
