### About the course

The course provides knowledge and practical skills to build client applications (Single Page Applications) using one of the most popular working frameworks. Architectural templates for SPA applications, components and more are studied. Data visualization views and templates (templates), patterns, data binding, multi-view handling, routing, data extraction from REST services are studied.

The training provides knowledge and practical skills to develop Single Page Applications (SPA) using ReactJS technology, one of the most popular and fastest client interface rendering libraries developed and supported by Facebook and Instagram. We'll pay special attention to JSX syntax, working with queries and Promises, splitting an application into components, routing and validating forms, and different ways to style components using techniques like CSS Modules and Styled Components. We'll also look at new concepts in the library like React Hooks and the Context API. The training will also emphasize writing Unit Tests using JEST.
