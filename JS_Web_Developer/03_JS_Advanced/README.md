# JS Advanced

In the "JS Advanced" course, students will gain in-depth knowledge of the JavaScript language, such as the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes and writing functions. They will learn more complex concepts such as function context, explicit binding, event loop. The course will develop their algorithmic thinking. Upon successful completion of this course, they will have the opportunity to work with the DOM tree, manipulate it, and work with "events". Functional and OOP approaches to programming with JavaScript will be explored, learning concepts such as inheritance, object composition and prototype chain.
