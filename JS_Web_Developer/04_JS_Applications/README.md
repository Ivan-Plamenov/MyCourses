# JS Applications

In the JS Applications course, students will learn what HTTP requests are and how to use them. They will learn about REST Services, what is a Baas (backend as a service) and how to work with it, what is asynchronous code (Promises, using async/await), what are Templating and Routing. During the course they will create Single Page Application using the techniques learned in previous lectures, which will be assessed. They will understand the architecture of an application and how to properly structure their applications. Towards the end of the course they will look at different design patterns and their practical direction, create their own web components using the Web Components standard and build a Wepback environment from scratch.
