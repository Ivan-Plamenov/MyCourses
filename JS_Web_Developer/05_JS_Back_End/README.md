# JS Back End

The course is intensive and aims to introduce students to developing server-side JavaScript applications on the Node.js platform using Express.js as a framework. During the course, learners will understand how to create a server with Node.js, learn the server-client architecture and how to make easy and fast data-driven web applications with Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB using modern techniques and tools. One of the most popular non-relational databases, MongoDB, will be covered along with the Mongoose library for taking data from it. By the end of the course, you will build a complete REST API from scratch using Express.js and MongoDB. There is a lot of emphasis on hands-on exercises that will engage learners in real-world projects of building web pages, implementing site snippets, and creating complete modern websites with good looks, modern structure, and mobile support.
