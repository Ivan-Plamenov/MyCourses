In the "JS Front-End" course, students will gain a basic understanding of JavaScript, such as the basics of syntax, working with arrays, matrices, objects, classes, and writing functions. The course will develop their algorithmic thinking. Upon successful completion of this course, they will have the opportunity to work with the DOM tree, make manipulations on it and work with "events". Functional and OOP approaches to programming with JavaScript will be covered. Data transfer concepts using HTTP and REST will be studied.
