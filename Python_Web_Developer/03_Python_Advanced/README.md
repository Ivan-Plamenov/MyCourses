# Python Advanced

### About the Course

The Python Advanced course builds on your Python skills by exploring more complex concepts typical of the language. In the course, students will learn to create linear data structures, solve algorithmic problems (problem solving skills), work with Stacks & Queues, Tuples & Sets, Matrices (Multidimensional Lists), and files and directories. Attention will be paid to the functional programming paradigm. Recursive functions and functions with multiple arguments will be covered in depth. The development environment to be used by the trainee team is PyCharm, but each trainee is free to use tools of preference.
