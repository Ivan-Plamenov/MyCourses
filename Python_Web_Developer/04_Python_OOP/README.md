# Python OOP

### About the Course

The Python OOP course will teach students the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP), how to work with classes and objects, use object-oriented modeling, and build class hierarchies. Basic OOP principles such as abstraction (interfaces, abstract classes), encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism will be studied. You will go into the most commonly used design patterns (creational, structural and behavioral design patterns). They will learn SOLID principles for object-oriented software design. They will learn what iterators and generators are and how to use them. They will learn how to create and use decorators. They will focus on component testing (writing unit tests) and the concept of Test Driven Development (TDD).
