# Python Web Basics

In the "Python Web Basics" course, we'll cover the basics of web programming with Python and Django. We'll look at how networks really work, what HTTP is, and the basic principles of web development. We'll learn how to work with databases and write basic SQL queries using pgAdmin. In this course, we will explore the basic concepts in MTV (Model-Template-View) architecture, and in addition to these, we will use forms (Form and ModelForm) for application development, work with media files, and store data in PostgreSQL. The training includes hands-on labs and workshops to build complete, full-featured Django web applications.
