# Python ORM

### About the Course

The course covers the basics of mapping between a relational base and an object-oriented model (ORM) with a focus on the Django framework. It starts with an introduction to ORM and its key concepts before moving on to working with models in Django, including defining models, fields and methods. The course then delves into advanced topics such as Django's migrations and admin interface, query operations, relationships between models, and inheritance. Students will also learn more advanced techniques for working with models and handling ORM queries in Django. The course also, covers another popular Python ORM framework - SQLAlchemy, which offers an alternative approach. Exercises will be provided throughout the course to help participants reinforce their knowledge at each step. By the end of this course, they will gain the basic skills to build robust, scalable and efficient database-driven web applications using Python ORM frameworks.
